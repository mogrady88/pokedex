TODO:

more features - better pokemon details, some save search functionality, more info at a glance
more efficient - im loading all pokemon data right at initial load. A better way to do it would be to load the minimum (name, id) and then do a call when you click on a pokemon to get the full details. I chose to get all data since it was an assessment and i was more interested in having all of my data for reference during development. This should be refactored
more styling - this thing is bare bones and I would love to include some more color, box shadows on each of the pokemon cards, a flashier modal, etc
